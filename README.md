# R10
#### A React Native Application!

##### R10 is a mobile application for an imaginary developer conference. It allows the user to view the conference schedule, find time, location and speaker details of individual sessions, and to 'favourite' a session (which is then included in an easily accessible 'faves' list). R10 is ios and android compatible.

##### Other R10 attributes include an external link from each speaker pop-up screen which takes the user to said speaker's wikipedia page on the browser, tab navigation between screens on ios and drawer navigation on android, and an animated about screen.
