# R10
#### A React Native Application!

R10 is a mobile application for an imaginary developer conference. It allows the user to view the conference schedule, the panel times, and the location and speaker details of individual sessions. The user can also 'favourite' a session, which is then included in an easily accessible 'faves' list.

Other R10 attributes include an external link from each speaker pop-up screen which takes the user to said speaker's wikipedia page on the browser, tab navigation between screens on ios and drawer navigation on android, and an animated about screen.

R10 is ios and android compatible!
